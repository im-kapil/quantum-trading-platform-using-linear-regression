Quantum Trading Platform Using Linear Regression is a Python-based trading analytics platform that leverages linear regression and technical indicators to predict stock price movements. The platform provides a structured pipeline for financial data analysis, feature engineering, and model training, enabling systematic, data-driven trading strategies.

Key Features:

Fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance

Computes technical indicators manually: SMA, RSI, Momentum, Bollinger Bands, MACD

Calculates returns for short-term prediction targets

Prepares features for ML models (Linear Regression)

Trains, evaluates, and saves models for future predictions

Modular structure for easy extension with additional indicators or models

Ideal For:

Quantitative analysts exploring algorithmic trading strategies

Machine learning enthusiasts working on financial time series prediction

Developers building a scalable and reusable trading ML pipeline

3️⃣ Target Variable

For regression: Close_t+1 → next day’s close

For momentum direction: sign(Close_t+1 − Close_t) → +1 (up), 0 (neutral), −1 (down)

We can train separate models for each if needed.

4️⃣ Model Selection
Because this is a serious trading application, we should start with strong, interpretable models:

| Type                                     | Use Case                               | Pros                                          | Cons                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **XGBoost / LightGBM / CatBoost**        | Regression / Classification            | Handles tabular data well, robust to outliers | Not great for sequential dependencies |
| **LSTM / GRU (RNNs)**                    | Sequence prediction                    | Can model temporal dependencies               | Needs more data, harder to train      |
| **Transformer-based Time Series Models** | Sequence prediction                    | Can model long-term dependencies              | More complex, more compute            |
| **Hybrid**                               | Combine technical indicators with LSTM | Best of both worlds                           | Requires careful tuning               |

**PO Decision: Start with XGBoost/LightGBM for initial benchmark, then move to LSTM or Temporal Fusion Transformer for capturing sequential patterns.**
